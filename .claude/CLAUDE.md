# HaLow AT Command Tool - Development Journal

## Project Overview
AT command configuration tool for Taixin TX-AH-R WiFi HaLow Modules with comprehensive debugging and protocol analysis capabilities.

## Development Sessions

### Session 2025-09-08: Major v4.0 Release - Protocol Analysis & Debugging Suite

#### Context
- Friend testing remotely getting error: "Error binding socket: [Errno 42] Protocol not available" on macOS (en7 interface)
- Need to fix cross-platform compatibility and add comprehensive debugging
- Have access to manufacturer's AT command documentation in Chinese (English translation)
- Original code was human attempt to recreate manufacturer's netat.exe tool

#### Analysis of Documentation
- Protocol uses UDP port 56789 for network communication
- Packet format: CMD(1) + LEN(2) + DEST_MAC(6) + SRC_MAC(6) + DATA(variable)
- AT commands should end with CR+LF (\r\n)
- Supports both serial UART and network communication
- Response format: +COMMAND:value followed by OK/ERROR

#### Major Changes Implemented

**üîß Core Protocol Fixes:**
- Fixed packet structure with proper header parsing (15-byte header)
- Added CR+LF termination for AT commands as per spec
- Enhanced response parsing for +COMMAND:value format
- Implemented proper cookie/session tracking for request-response correlation

**üì° Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
- Added multiple socket binding methods (Linux SO_BINDTODEVICE, IP binding, fallback to any interface)
- Enhanced error handling for macOS "Protocol not available" issue
- Added interface IP lookup using netifaces library
- Fallback to 0.0.0.0 binding with --any flag

**üîç Advanced Debugging Features:**
- Comprehensive packet analysis with detailed hex dumps
- Verbose logging with colored terminal output
- Real-time packet inspection showing command names and structure
- Packet capture to JSON files for post-analysis
- Raw packet mode for protocol testing and reverse engineering

**üéØ Serial Port Support:**
- Added complete serial UART communication as fallback
- PySerial integration with proper configuration (115200 8N1)
- Threading for simultaneous read/write operations
- Auto-detection guidance for serial ports across platforms

**‚ö° User Experience Enhancements:**
- Quick setup commands (--quick-ap, --quick-sta)
- AT command helper shortcuts (rssi, status, scan, pair)
- Interactive help system with comprehensive command reference
- Command-line interface with extensive options

**üìä Reverse Engineering Tools:**
- Raw packet mode for manual packet crafting
- Hex input support for testing different packet structures
- Packet structure analysis with ASCII interpretation
- Device MAC address mapping for 1-to-many mode

#### Key Technical Solutions

**Problem**: macOS "Protocol not available" error
**Root Cause**: SO_BINDTODEVICE is Linux-specific, not available on macOS
**Solution**: Added fallback binding methods:
1. Try Linux SO_BINDTODEVICE first
2. Fall back to IP address binding via interface lookup
3. Final fallback to 0.0.0.0 with --any flag

**Problem**: AT command format compatibility
**Root Cause**: Original code didn't match manufacturer specification
**Solution**: 
- Added proper CR+LF termination
- Enhanced response parsing for documented format
- Implemented command/response correlation via cookies

**Problem**: Limited debugging capabilities
**Root Cause**: Need to analyze actual protocol for troubleshooting
**Solution**: Added comprehensive debugging suite:
- Packet-level hex dumps
- Real-time protocol analysis
- Capture capabilities for offline analysis
- Raw packet mode for testing

#### Testing Strategy for Remote Friend

Created comprehensive testing guide with 4 methods:

1. **Network Interface Testing**: Multiple binding approaches
2. **Serial Port Testing**: Direct UART communication
3. **Raw Packet Analysis**: Protocol reverse engineering
4. **Packet Capture Analysis**: Offline protocol examination

Each method includes step-by-step commands and expected outputs.

#### Files Modified
- `pylibnetat.py`: Complete rewrite to v4.0 (1,334 lines)
- `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation with troubleshooting guide
- Added colored logging, packet analysis, serial support, and debugging tools

#### Current Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- All planned features implemented
- Cross-platform compatibility addressed  
- Comprehensive debugging suite in place
- Documentation updated with testing procedures
- Code pushed to GitHub repository

#### Next Steps if Current Implementation Fails
1. **Packet Analysis**: Use verbose mode and packet capture to see actual device responses
2. **Protocol Adjustment**: Modify packet structure based on captured data
3. **Serial Fallback**: Use UART connection if network protocol differs
4. **Reverse Engineering**: Raw packet mode to test different packet formats

#### Learning Notes
- macOS has different socket binding requirements than Linux
- Manufacturer documentation matches standard AT command protocols
- UDP broadcast discovery is standard for embedded device configuration
- Multiple fallback methods essential for cross-platform compatibility
- Comprehensive debugging tools crucial for remote troubleshooting

#### Repository State
- Version: 4.0
